 # Why React ?
 We can use states which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the app
 We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
 React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating the actual DOM

 -- Debuggin and maintainance is easy
